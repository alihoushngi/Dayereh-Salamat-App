# 🩺 Dayereh Salamat - Women's Health & Medical Consultation PWA

**Dayereh Salamat** is a Progressive Web App focused on **women's health and wellness**, enabling users to connect with top **specialist doctors in gynecology and women's diseases**. Some features of the app are also available for men to benefit from expert consultations.

> 🛠 Originally developed 5 years ago with [Next.js 10](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10), the project was outdated and missing a desktop version. I decided to refactor and redesign it entirely using the latest technologies and best practices.
